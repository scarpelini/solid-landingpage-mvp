  "text": "<p>Building a minimum viable product doesn't mean lowering quality standards regarding design or code. It will be simple, not simplistic. It will be lean, not sketchy.<br><br>We always look to impress the target audience by delivering something that inspires them to act.</p><h2>A minimum viable product represents the fastest way to develop, validate, and learn about the business hypothesis by testing it against the real world.</h2><p>Our goal is to deliver something that helps you to learn enough to make your next decision as fast as possible, keeping down costs and time to market.</p><h2>Build, measure, learn & iterate, fast!</h2>"
